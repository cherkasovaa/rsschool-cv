## Summary

I am a self-motivated young developer with experience working in a game development company, where I successfully handled assigned tasks. Although circumstances required me to leave my job, I have not given up my passion for development and continue to improve in this field, even without prior experience in frontend development.

I have the ability to independently solve problems and enjoy diving into code to find optimal solutions.

Additionally, I use my free time to create instructional videos on JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3. This helps me pursue my favorite hobby and also allows me to believe that I can help others in their learning process.

## Code examples:

**KATA from CODEWARS:** _Usually when you buy something, you're asked whether your credit card number, phone number or answer to your most secret question is still correct. However, since someone could look over your shoulder, you don't want that shown on your screen. Instead, we mask it. Your task is to write a function maskify, which changes all but the last four characters into '#'_

```javascript
function maskify(cc) {
  let result = cc.split('')
                  .map((n, i, arr) => arr.length - 5 &lt; i ? n : "#")
                  .join('');

  return result;
}
```
